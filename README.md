# Deployment of Clearwater vIMS with Openstack Murano

This project and (documentation  ) presents two major ways in which Openstack Murano can be used for Orchestration of vIMS.
Openstack Murano is NOT an orchestrator itself but an Application Catalog that provides an easy way to deploy and manage cloud ready applications.
It can be easily combined with an orchestrator to provide complete VNF Lifecycle Management.
Some of the definitions and architecture references have been take from Openstack and Cloudify documentation.
